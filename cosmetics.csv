TriPollar DESIRE Toning Device;TriPollar;$529.00;https://static.thcdn.com/images/large/original//productimg/1600/1600/13525895-5264929312774144.jpg;Get professional results faster than ever. The TriPollar DESIRE offers the most efficient pure RF treatment yet, giving you aesthetic results both immediately and with lasting natural outcomes. The Turbo function specifically designed for the TriPollar DESIRE contributes to highly effective treatment with fast, focused RF heating of the tissue, made more tailored by the Thermal Mapping Algorithm. This TriPollar device delivers RF energy into the dermis skin layer to naturally build collagen and repair elastin for a lifted, smoothed, and plumped effect from the very first use. Users enjoy a reduction in the appearance of wrinkles, toning and refining of facial features, and plumping and tightening of sagging skin. Using the TriPollar DESIRE regularly can effectively erase the signs of aging.;The TriPollar DESIRE uses TriPollar 3rd Generation technology, the newest, most up to date radio frequency technology on the market, clinically proven to offer great results, and boosts its results further with the addition of the Turbo feature and Thermal Mapping Algorithm. TriPollar 3rd Generation Technology uses three alternating RF currents (rather than one, or two) to cover and treat a large treatment area which provides more efficient heating, a more even distribution of heat across the skin, and a shorter necessary treatment time. With the addition of the Turbo feature, this is amplified to an efficiency that TriPollar Multi-RF has been unable to achieve previously. When skin is warmed to the ideal temperature, Multi-RF energy is delivered into the dermis skin layer, stimulating dermal activity and increasing and accelerating the natural production of collagen and elastin. The addition of the Turbo feature means that this is achieved more efficiently for shorter treatment times while the Thermal Mapping Algorithm controls the heating process by continually sampling the tissue temperature, meaning the device temperature is adjusted to fit the specific characteristics of the treated area, achieving a personalized treatment pattern for individual, optimal results.
